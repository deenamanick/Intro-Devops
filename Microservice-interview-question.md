# Microservices Best Practices (Interview-Oriented)

## Follow SRP and Design Principles
   
  * Single Responsibility Principle (SRP): Each microservice should have one clearly defined responsibility. This ensures high cohesion and ease of maintenance.
  
  * Independence & Isolation: Design services to function independently and remain isolated from other services' internal logic.
  
  * Autonomy: Services should make decisions and own their data without relying on others.
  
  * Loose Coupling: Ensure minimal dependencies between services. This promotes scalability and simplifies changes.
